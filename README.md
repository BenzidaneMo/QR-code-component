- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

During the QR code component challenge using HTML and CSS, I learned several important techniques that helped me to create a visually appealing and functional component. 

- One of the key takeaways was **how to center a div** element using CSS grid, which allowed me to position the container on the page precisely. 
- I also learned **how to use variables** to refer to colors, which made it much easier to update the color scheme of my component without having to search and replace every instance of a specific color value.
- Finally, I gained an understanding of **how to use media queries** to make my website more dynamic and responsive, which is critical for ensuring that the component looks good on screens of all sizes.

By applying these techniques, I was able to create a perfect clone that met the requirements of the challenge.
